# Graphical Solution Method

## Project Description
This group project demonstrates the Graphical Solution Method, a technique for solving linear programming (LP) problems with two decision variables. The approach involves graphing constraints and identifying feasible regions to optimize an objective function.

## Language & Libraries
- **Python**
- **NumPy** (`numpy`) – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** (`matplotlib.pyplot`) – for graphical visualization
- **PuLP** (`pulp`) – for solving linear programming problems
- **itertools** (`combinations`) – for generating combinations of constraints

## Features & Analyses

- Graphical representation of constraints and feasible regions
- Intersection of constraint lines to determine feasible solutions
- Optimization of the objective function (maximization or minimization)
